 - remove unused / unwanted Maps markers,
 - display POI (Points of Interest) provided by diffents API or JSON files (examples with Bordeaux: scouter's stations, parks...) 
 - mark as favourite a specific place,
 - handle different themes for the initial map,
 - display direction / route between two locations.

PS: a google token is needed (cf. .env.sample)
